A sample Gradle plugin demonstrating established techniques and practices for plugin development as described in the following guides:

- link:https://guides.gradle.org/designing-gradle-plugins/[Designing Gradle plugins]
- link:https://guides.gradle.org/implementing-gradle-plugins/[Implementing Gradle plugins]

== Applied techniques and practices

- Production source code written in Java, test code written in Groovy.
- Reusable logic written as binary plugin.
- Usage of the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/javaGradle_plugin.html[Plugin Development plugin] to simplify plugin development.
- Implementation of tasks as custom task type.
- Usage of input and output properties to enable incremental tasks.
- Usage of an extension to capture user-configurable values.
- Mapping of extension property values to custom task properties.
- Reacting to plugins instead of applying plugins.
- Declaration of appropriate plugin identifiers.
- Functional testing with link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/test_kit.html[TestKit].
