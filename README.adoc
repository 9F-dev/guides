:portal: Gradle Plugin Portal
:plugin: Greeting Plugin
:publishplugin: Plugin Publishing Plugin

Provides a brief introduction to publishing and how it works
Makes concrete statements about what the plugin portal is and isn't

== What you'll build

You will take an exisisting plugin and configure its project so that the plugin is publishable ÃŸto the {portal}.

== What you'll need

* About 25 minutes
* A text editor
* A command prompt
* The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.7 or higher
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or better
* Source code for an existing Gradle plugin. (Preferably your own).

//Describes the process of publishing (on an architectural high-level view)
//
//What's the Plugin Publishing Plugin and how does it function internally?
//
//Using and configuring the Plugin Publishing Plugin

NOTE: If you have never written a plugin, you can look at the https://github.com/gradle-guides/greeting-plugin-example[Greeting Plugin example], but please do not try to publish this to the {portal}. You can also look at {guides}

== Create an account on the {portal}

*TBC*

== Add the {publishplugin} to the project

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::{exampledir}/build.gradle[tags=plugins_block]
----

== Configure the {publishplugin}

*TBC: These settings are set for the whole plugin bundle*

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::{exampledir}/build.gradle[tags=plugin_bundle]
----
<1> Everything for the plugin is configured in the `pluginBundle` extension block.
<2> Set the website for your plugin's project
<3> Provide the source repository URI so that others can find it if they want to contribute.

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
pluginBundle {

include::{exampledir}/build.gradle[tags=plugin_definitions,indent=2]

}
----
<1> Each plugin in a bundle is specified in the `plugins` block. As you are only publishing a single plugin at this point there will only be one entry, but should your project publish a bundle in future you will list each of them in here.
<2> The name for each plugin block does not affect the plugin configuration, but they need to be unique for each plugin provided in the `plugins` block.
<3> This is the same identifier specified as the name of plugin properties file that is located in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/gradle-plugins` directory.
<4> Set the plugin name in human-readable form.
<5> Set a description that will be displayed on the portal. Although this is optional it provides useful information to people would might want to use your plugin.
<6> Set tags that might build script authors might use to search for plugin types. This can make your plugin easier to locate.
<7> By default the version from `project.version` will be used, but you can set your own version if required.

== Publish your plugin

*TBC*

== Consume the published plugin
