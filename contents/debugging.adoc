== Debugging and diagnosing cache misses

For using task output caching efficiently it is essential to keep the balance between specifying all the inputs to your
tasks while not over-specifying them. If you don't specify enough of your inputs then your build will be incorrect and you
will share outputs between tasks that should have had a different output. If you specify unnecessary inputs to your tasks,
 you will have cache misses while you could have reused earlier outputs.
 For Gradle's built-in tasks we prefer to err on the side of correctness and we suggest that you do the same.

This chapter is about finding out why a cache miss was happening. If you have a cache hit which you didn't expect we
suggest to declare whatever change you expected to trigger the cache miss as an input to the task.

=== How to find problems with task output caching

In order to find existing problems with your usage of task output caching you can do a variety of things.

First, you should start out with running a fully up-to-date build.
You do not even have to enable the build cache for this exercise.
The expected outcome is that that all incremental tasks are up-to-date.
Tasks which have no output or no inputs will always be executed, but that shouldn't be a problem.
If you find some tasks which are out of date then use the methods from <<diagnosing_cache_miss>> to determine the changed inputs for the tasks and use the methods from <<common-problems>> to fix those tasks.
The goal is to achieve <<stable_task_inputs>> for cacheable tasks.
If you find a task which is out of date but no cacheable tasks depend on its outcome then you don't have to do anything about it.

When you are happy with the up-to-date performance then you can repeat the experiment above but this time with a clean build and the build cache turned on.
The goal with clean builds and the build cache turned on is to retrieve all cacheable tasks from the cache.
You should start out simple and use the same checkout for the consumer build.
When you are happy with the performance in the single workspace use-case you can go further:

- Use different workspaces on the same machine.
- Use different workspaces on different machines using a remote build cache.
- Use the cache populated by a CI build and a developer machine.

After these experiments with fully cache builds you can go on and try to make typical changes to your project and see if enough tasks are still cached.
If the results are not satisfactory you should think about restructuring your project to reduce dependencies between different tasks.

We had good experiences with recording execution times of our builds, generate graphs of those and then look at the results.
You then can look for certain patterns, like a rebuilding everything even though you expected compilation to be cached.

You can also make certain changes to your code base manually or automatically and check that the expected set of tasks is cached.

If these experiments point to a possible problem with your use of task output caching, you would need to go into diagnosing a cache miss as explained below.

=== Helpful data for diagnosing a cache miss

A cache miss happens when Gradle calculates a build cache key for a task which is different from any of the build cache keys in the cache.
Only comparing the build cache key on its own does not give much information, so we need to look at some finer grained data to be able to diagnose the cache miss.
All the things influencing the build cache key can be found in the {user-manual}build_cache.html#sec:task_output_caching_details[userguide].

Basically, we can compare the following data, listed from coarse grained to fine grained:

* Build cache keys
* Task and Task action implementations
** classloader hash
** class name
* Task output property names
* Individual task property input hashes
* Hashes of files which are part of task input properties

Currently, the build cache key for the task is logged at the info level,
while information down to the individual input property level is available in the info log:

If you want to go into the details of finding out e.g. which classes and jar files constitute the `classpath` for the `compileJava`
task you need to resort to comparing those files on disk yourself.

Luckily, you do not have to capture this data yourself - the build scan plugin already takes care of this for you.
This means that Gradle Enterprise already has the necessary data to diagnose the cache miss when using the build scan plugin.

Note that it is also possible that task output caching for a cacheable task was disabled.
When this happens the reason why caching was disabled for the task is reported on the info log level and in the build scan.

=== Diagnosing the reasons for a cache miss

Having the data from the last section at hand, you should be able to diagnose why the outputs of a certain task were not found in the build cache.
Since you were expecting more tasks to be cached, you should be able to pinpoint a build which would have produced the artifact under question.

Before diving into how to find out why one task has not been loaded from the cache we should first look into which task caused the cache misses.
There is a cascade effect causing dependent tasks to be executed if one of the tasks earlier in the build is not loaded from the cache and has different outputs.
Therefore, you should therefore at the first cacheable task which was executed and continue investigating there.
This can be done from the timeline view in a build scan or from the task input comparison directly.

image::first-non-cached-task.png[]

At first, you should check if the implementation of the task changed. This would mean checking the class names and classloader hashes
for the task class itself and for each of its action. If there is a change, this means that the build script, `buildSrc` or the Gradle version has changed.

If the implementation is the same, then you need to start comparing inputs between the two builds.
There should be at least one different input hash. If it is a simple value property, then the configuration of the task changed.
This can happen for example by

 * changing the build script,
 * conditionally configuring the task differently for CI or the developer builds,
 * depending on a system property or an environment variable for the task configuration,
 * or having an absolute path which is part of the input.

If the changed property is a file property, then the reasons can be the same as for the change of a value property.
Most probably though a file on the filesystem changed in a way that Gradle detects a difference for this input.
The most common case will be that the source code was changed by a check in.
It is also possible that a file generated by a task changed, e.g. since it includes a timestamp.
Note that the Java version can also influence the output of the Java compiler.
If you did not expect the file to be an input to the task, then it is possible that you should alter the configuration of the task to not include it.
For example, having your integration test configuration including all the unit test classes as a dependency has the effect that all integration tests
are re-executed when a unit test changes.
Another option is that the task tracks absolute paths instead of relative paths and the location of the project directory changed on disk.

=== Example

We will walk you through the process of diagnosing a cache miss.
Let's say we have build `A` and build `B` and we expected all the test tasks for a sub-project `sub1` to be cached in build `B` since only a unit test for another sub-project `sub2` changed.
Actually, all the tests for the sub-project have been executed.
Since we have the cascading effect when we have cache misses, we need to find the task which caused the caching chain to fail.
This can easily be done by filtering for all cacheable tasks which have been executed and then select the first one.
In our case, it turns out that the tests for the sub-project `internal-testing` were executed even though there was no code change to this project.
We start the input property comparison in Gradle Enterprise and see that the property `classpath` changed. This means that some file on the runtime classpath actually did change.
Looking deeper into this, we actually see that the inputs for the task `processResources` changed in that project, too.
Finally, we find this in our build file:

[source,groovy]
----
task currentVersionInfo() {
    doLast {
        def properties = new Properties()
        properties.latestMilestone = version
        properties.store(new File(generatedResourcesDir, "currentVersion.properties"))
    }
}

sourceSets.main.output.dir generatedResourcesDir, builtBy: currentVersionInfo
----

Since properties files stored by Java's `Properties.store` method contain a timestamp, this will cause a change to the runtime classpath every time the build runs.
Note that the compile classpath is not affected since compile avoidance ignores non-class files on the compile classpath.
In order to solve this problem see <<volatile_outputs>>.
