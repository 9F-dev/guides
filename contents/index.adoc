= Building Java Applications

This guide demonstrates how to create a Java application in the standard form using Gradle's Build Init plugin.

== What you'll need

* About [.time-to-complete-text]#NN#
* A text editor
* A command prompt
* The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.7 or higher
* Any recent Gradle distribution

== Check the user manual

Gradle comes with a built-in plugin called the Build Init plugin. It is documented in the Gradle User Manual at https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_init_plugin.html.

The plugin has one task, called `init`, that generates the project. The `init` task calls the (also built-in) `wrapper` task to create a Gradle wrapper script, `gradlew`.

To run the `init` task, you run the following from a command prompt:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ gradle init --type <name>
----

where `name` is one of the following:

* `java-application`
* `java-library`
* `scala-library`
* `groovy-library`
* `basic`

This guide uses the `java-application` type.

The first step is to create a folder for the new project and change directory into it.

[listing.terminal]
----
$ mkdir java-demo
$ cd java-demo
----

== Run the init task

From inside the new project directory, run the `init` task with the `java-application` argument.

[listing.terminal]
----
$ gradle init --type java-application
Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)
include::{samplesoutputdir}/init.txt[]

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

The `init` task runs the `wrapper` task first, which generates the `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` wrapper scripts. Then it creates the new project with the following structure:

[listing]
----
├── build.gradle
├── gradle    // <1>
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
├── settings.gradle
└── src
    ├── main
    │   └── java  // <2>
    │       └── App.java
    └── test      // <3>
        └── java
            └── AppTest.java
----
<1> Generated folder for wrapper files
<2> Default Java source folder
<3> Default Java test folder

== Review the generated project files

The `settings.gradle` file is heavily commented, but has only one active line:

.settings.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/settings.gradle[]
----

This assigns the name of the root project to `java-demo`, which is the default.

The generated `build.gradle` file also has many comments. The active portion is reproduced here (note version numbers for the dependencies may be updated in later versions of Gradle):

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/build.gradle[]
----
<1> public Bintray Artifactory repository
<2> Google Guava library
<3> JUnit testing library
<4> Class with "main" method (used by Application plugin)

The build file adds the `java` and `application` plugins. The former support Java projects. The latter lets you designate one class as having a `main` method, which can be executed by the build from the command line. In the demo, the name of the `main` class is `App`.

The file `src/main/java/App.java` is shown here:

.src/main/java/App.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/src/main/java/App.java[]
----
<1> Called by Application plugin "run" task

The test class, `src/test/java/AppTest.java` is shown next:

.src/test/java/AppTest.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/src/test/java/AppTest.java[]
----

The generated test class has a single test annotated with JUnit's `@Test` annotation. The test instantiates the `App` class, invokes the `getGreeting` method, and checks that the returned value is not null.

== Execute the build

To build the project, run the `build` command. You can use the regular `gradle` command, but when a project includes a wrapper script, it is considered good form to use it instead.

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew build
include::{samplesoutputdir}/build.txt[]

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

NOTE: The first time you run the wrapper script, `gradlew`, there may be a delay while that version of `gradle` is downloaded and stored locally in your `~/.gradle/wrapper/dists` folder.

The first time you run the build, Gradle will check whether or not you already have the Guava and JUnit libraries in your cache under your `~/.gradle` directory. If not, the libraries will be downloaded and stored there. The next time you run the build, the cached versions will be used. The `build` task compiles the classes, runs the tests, and generates a test report.

You can view the test report by opening the HTML output file, located at `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.

A sample report is shown here:

== Run the application

Because the Gradle build used the Application plugin, you can run the application from the command line. First, use the `tasks` task to see what task has been added by the plugin.

----
$ ./gradlew tasks
:tasks

------------------------------------------------------------
All tasks runnable from root project
------------------------------------------------------------

Application tasks
-----------------
run - Runs this project as a JVM application

// ... many other tasks ...
----

The `run` task tells Gradle to execute the `main` method in the class assigned to the `mainClassName` property.

----
$ ./gradlew run
include::{samplesoutputdir}/run.txt[]


BUILD SUCCESSFUL

== Summary

You now have a new Java project that you generated using Gradle's build init plugin. In the process, you saw:

* How to generate a Java application
* How the generated build file and sample Java files are structured
* How to run the build and view the test report
* How to execute a Java application using the `run` task from the Application plugin
