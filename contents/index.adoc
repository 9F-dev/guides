= Building Java 9 Modules

== What you'll learn

One of the most exciting features of Java 9 is its support for developing and
deploying modular Java software. In this guide, you'll learn exactly what you
need to change in your Java application to:

* produce Java 9 modules for your java libraries.
* consume Java 9 modules as your dependencies.
* use Java's `ServiceLoader` pattern with Java 9 modules.
* run an application using Java 9 modules.
* distribute your application as an optimized Java 9 runtime image.

While Gradle version {gradle-version} doesn't have first-class support for
Java 9 modules, this guide shows you how to experiment with them before that
support is added.

== What you'll need

* About +++<span class="time-to-complete-text">30 minutes</span>+++
* A text editor
* A command prompt
* The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.9 (build 170) or newer
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version}
  or newer

== Understanding the Example Project

This guide explains step-by-step how to convert an example Java application
which doesn't use any Java 9 features into a fully-modular Java 9 application.
The source code for the original version of the application lives in the
`src/0-original` directory. It is organized as multi-project Gradle build made
up of six subprojects:

* `fairy` - The entry point to the storyteller java application.
* `tale` - A library which defines the public `Tale` interface.
* `formula` - A library which makes it easy to weave a `Tale`.
* `actors` - A library which represents the characters in a fairy tale.
* `pigs` - A library which produces an instance of `Tale` which represents the
  story of the three little pigs.
* `bears` - A library which produces an instance of `Tale` which represents the
  story of Goldilocks and the three bears.

The project hierarchy showing the dependency relationships between the six
projects can be seen in the following illustration:
