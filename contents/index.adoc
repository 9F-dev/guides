// TODO rephrase
In this guide we will look at the main differences between Gradle's Groovy DSL and Kotlin DSL by comparing build scripts doing common things, introducing the main idioms of the Kotlin DSL.
We'll also discuss possible migration strategies in the light of the structure of builds.
Last but not least we'll learn how the two DSLs inter-operate.

[TIP]
The Gradle link:{user-manual}[user manual] and link:{guides}[guides] contain build script excerpts that demonstrate both the Groovy DSL and the Kotlin DSL.
This is the best place where to find how to do this and what with each DSL ; and it covers all Gradle features from link:{user-manual}plugins.html[using plugins] to link:{user-manual}customizing_dependency_resolution_behavior.html[customizing the dependency resolution behavior].


== Groovy vs. Kotlin DSL tradeoffs

Gradle is implemented in Java on top of the JVM.
Both the Groovy DSL and the Kotlin DSL are implemented on top of the Gradle Java API.

Kotlin and Groovy languages are very different beasts, each with its own strengths.
Kotlin is statically typed, has null safety built-in, hence is quite strict.
Groovy on the other hand is highly dynamic by nature, hence is very flexible.

[NOTE]
If you want to read on Kotlin the language before getting started or if you need some reference documentation along the way, the link:{kotlin-reference}[reference documentation] is the place to go.
The https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html[Kotlin Koans] provide a fun way to learn Kotlin.

The Kotlin language being more strict than Groovy also means that the Gradle Kotlin DSL is more strict than the Gradle Groovy DSL.
Both share the same ultimate goal though: provide means to interact with the dynamic and extensible Gradle model, and runtime.

It takes more ceremony to do dynamic things with the Kotlin DSL.
On the other hand it provides more safety and more tooling.

Applying Gradle best practices tend towards more declarative builds, less dynamic constructs. This is where the Kotlin DSL shines with the less ceremony and the more tooling. In that sense, the Kotlin DSL encourages Gradle best practices.

[TIP]
--
*Applying Gradle best practices will make it much easier with the Kotlin DSL*

Your first move should be to link:{user-manual}gradle_wrapper.html#sec:upgrading_wrapper[upgrade to the latest stable Gradle release].

Please refer to the link:{user-manual}authoring_maintainable_build_scripts.html[Authoring Maintainable Build Scripts] and link:{user-manual}organizing_build_logic.html[Organizing Build Logic] user manual chapters.
In general, follow the advice given in the Gradle link:{user-manual}[user manual] and link:{guides}[guides].

== IDE Support

IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio both support the edition of Gradle Kotlin DSL scripts and provide auto-completion, content assist, quick documentation, navigation to sources, refactoring and more.

image::intellij-idea-android-studio.png[IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio]

[CAUTION]
--
Note that when using IDEA files generated by the Gradle `idea` plugin, the IDE will not provide auto-completion nor refactoring nor everything in-between.
You must link:https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import[import the project from the Gradle model] instead.
--

Even though other IDEs have no support for code completion and content assist when editing Kotlin DSL scripts, importing and working with a Gradle build using the Kotlin DSL works as usual.
This is true for both link:https://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse], thanks to the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Buildship] project, and link:https://netbeans.apache.org/[Apache Netbeans], thanks to its link:https://github.com/kelemen/netbeans-gradle-project[Gradle plugin].


== Script file names

[NOTE]
--
Groovy DSL script files use the `*.gradle` file name extension.

Kotlin DSL script files use the `*.gradle.kts` file name extension.
--

To use the Kotlin DSL, simply name your files `build.gradle.kts` instead of `build.gradle`.

The `settings.gradle` file can also be renamed `settings.gradle.kts`.

In a multi-project build, you can have some modules using the Groovy DSL (and thus use `build.gradle` files), and some other modules using the Kotlin DSL (and thus use `build.gradle.kts` files). So you're not forced to migrate everything at once.

On top of that, the following conventions apply for better IDE support:

* scripts applied to `Settings` should be named `*.settings.gradle.kts`
* init scripts should be named `*.init.gradle.kts`


== Applying plugins

Just like with the Groovy DSL, there are two ways to apply Gradle plugins:

- declaratively, using the `plugins {}` block,
- imperatively, using the `apply(..)` functions.

Using the declarative `plugins {}` block:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'jacoco'
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.0.1.RELEASE'
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
plugins {
    java
    id("jacoco")
    id("org.springframework.boot") version "2.0.1.RELEASE"
}
----

[TIP]
You can switch from Groovy script excerpts to Kotlin ones to see their differences by clicking the tabs on top of them.

As you can see with the `jacoco` example, the same syntax can be used in Groovy and Kotlin (except for double quotes and parentheses that must be used in Kotlin).

The Kotlin DSL also defines Kotlin property extensions for all core Gradle plugins, so you can use them, as shown above with the `java` example.

You can also use the imperative `apply` syntax, but then non core plugins must be added to the classpath of the build script:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:2.0.1.RELEASE")
    }
}

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'jacoco'
apply plugin: 'org.springframework.boot'
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:2.0.1.RELEASE")
    }
}

apply(plugin = "java")
apply(plugin = "jacoco")
apply(plugin = "org.springframework.boot")
----

[IMPORTANT]
--
The declarative nature of the `plugins {}` block enables the Kotlin DSL to provide type safe discoverable accessors to what the applied plugins contribute (extensions, configurations etc...).
--


== Configuring plugins

Many plugins come with extensions to configure them. If those plugins are applied using the declarative `plugins {}` block (which is true for the `jacoco` plugin in the following example), then Kotlin extension functions are made available to configure their extension, the same way as in Groovy.

On the other hand, if you use the imperative `apply` function to apply a plugin (which is true for the checkstyle plugin in the following example), you'll have to use the `configure<T> {}` function to configure them:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
plugins {
    id("jacoco")
}
apply plugin: "checkstyle"

jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.1"
}

checkstyle {
    maxErrors = 10
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
plugins {
    jacoco
}
apply(plugin = "checkstyle")

jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.1"
}

configure<CheckstyleExtension> {
    maxErrors = 10
}
----

[TIP]
--
**What is the type of available extensions?**

In order to determine what type you need to use in your `configure<...>` call you can use the `:kotlinDslAccessorsReport` task. It prints the Kotlin code for accessing the extensions contributed by applied plugins and provides the name and type of all of them.
--

If the plugin you want to configure was written in Groovy and relies on `groovy.lang.Closure` or other dynamic Groovy semantics, a bit more gymnastic may be required.
See the <<interop>> section for more information on how to call Groovy code from Kotlin code or keep that plugin's configuration in a Groovy script.


[[declarative-scripts]]
== Keeping build scripts declarative

Plugins fetched from another source than the link:{plugin-portal}[Gradle Plugin Portal] may or may not be usable with the `plugins {}` block depending on how they have been published.
If you're publishing plugins, please use the Gradle built-in link:{user-manual}javaGradle_plugin.html[`java-gradle-plugin`] plugin that automates publication of the metadata necessary to make your plugins usable with the `plugins {}` block.

For example, the Android Gradle Plugin plugins are not published to the Gradle Plugin Portal and the metadata required to resolve plugin identifiers to resolvable artifacts link:https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/64551265[is not published] to the Google repository.

By default, the `com.android.application` plugin must be applied using the imperative `apply(..)` functions.
This means that the Kotlin DSL can't provide type safe Kotlin extensions to configure it:

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
import com.android.build.gradle.AppExtension

buildscript {                               <1>
    repositories {
        google()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.0")
    }
}

apply(plugin = "com.android.application")   <2>

configure<AppExtension> {                   <3>
    buildToolsVersion("27.0.0")
    compileSdkVersion(27)
}
----
<1> Bring the Android Gradle Plugin into the build script dependencies
<2> Imperatively apply the `com.android.application` plugin
<3> Use the `configure<T> {}` api to configure the `android` extension of type `com.android.build.gradle.AppExtension`

The following snippets will use the Android Gradle Plugin to demonstrate how to enable the use of the `plugins {}` block anyway in order to benefit from the Kotlin DSL type safe Kotlin extensions.

The goal here is to instruct your build how to map the `com.android.application` plugin identifier to a resolvable artifact.
This is done in two steps.

First add a plugin repository in your settings file for the whole build:

.settings.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        google()
    }
}
----

Then, map the plugin `id` to the corresponding artifact coordinates, still in your settings file:

.settings.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
pluginManagement {
    // ...
    resolutionStrategy {
        eachPlugin {
            if (requested.id.id == "com.android.application") {
                useModule("com.android.tools.build:gradle:${requested.version}")
            }
        }
    }
}
----

You can now apply the `com.android.application` plugin using the `plugins {}` block and benefit from the type-safe plugin extension accessors, in your build files:

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("com.android.application") version "3.1.0"   <1>
}

android {                                           <2>
    buildToolsVersion("27.0.0")
    compileSdkVersion(27)
}
----
<1> Declaratively request the `com.android.application` plugin
<2> Configure the `android` extension using Kotlin DSL type safe accessor

See the link:{user-manual}plugins.html#sec:plugin_management[Plugin Management] section of the Gradle documentation for more information.

The same can be applied to resolving plugins from composite builds.
Composite builds link:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/2528[do not expose plugin markers] yet.
This can be worked around by mapping the plugin `id` to the corresponding artifact coordinates using a plugin resolution strategy, just like above.

If you can't use the `plugins {}` block, you need to apply the plugin imperatively (using the `buildscript` block and `apply<PluginType>()` or `apply(plugin = "id")`) and to know the type of the extension(s) you want to configure as described previously.


== Configuring tasks

This is where Groovy and Kotlin start to differ. Since Kotlin is a statically typed language, and since you want to benefit from this static typing by discovering available properties and methods using auto-completion, you need to know and provide the type of the task you want to configure.

Here is how you can configure a single property of the existing `jar` task:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
jar.archiveName = 'foo.jar'
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
tasks.getByName<Jar>("jar").archiveName = "foo.jar"
----

[NOTE]
Note that specifying the type of the task explicitly is necessary. Otherwise, the script won't compile because the inferred type of `jar` will be `Task`, and the `archiveName` property is specific to the `Jar` task type.

You can, however, omit the type if you only need to configure properties or call methods declared in `Task`:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
test.doLast {
    println("test completed")
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
tasks["test"].doLast {
    println("test completed")
}
----

If you need to configure several properties or call multiple methods on the same task you can group them in a block as follows:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
jar {
    archiveName = 'foo.jar'
    into('META-INF') {
        from('bar')
    }
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
tasks.getByName<Jar>("jar") {
    archiveName = "foo.jar"
    into("META-INF") {
        from("bar")
    }
}
----

But there is another idiomatic way to configure tasks: using Kotlin link:link:{kotlin-reference}delegated-properties.html[delegated properties].
It is particularly useful if you need a reference to the task for later usage:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
jar {
    archiveName = 'foo.jar'
}

jar.into('META-INF') {
    from('bar')
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
val jar by tasks.getting(Jar::class) {
    archiveName = "foo.jar"
}

jar.into("META-INF") {
    from("bar")
}
----

Once again, note that if you need to apply task-specific configurations, you need to provide the type of the task (`Jar` in this example).

Once you know the type of the task you want to configure, the IDE will assist you in configuring it with suggestions and by providing the task source if need be.

[TIP]
--
**What is the type of that task?**

In order to determine the type you need to use to configure a task you can use the built-in `help` task, it displays the type of a task:

[source]
----
❯ ./gradlew help --task jar
...
Type
     Jar (org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar)
----
--

Let's say we want to configure the `bootJar` and `bootRun` tasks of a Spring Boot project:

[source]
----
❯ ./gradlew help --task bootJar
...
Type
     BootJar (org.springframework.boot.gradle.tasks.bundling.BootJar)
----

[source]
----
❯ ./gradlew help --task bootRun
...
Type
     BootRun (org.springframework.boot.gradle.tasks.run.BootRun)
----

We know now the type of the two tasks, the simple names (`BootJar` and `BootRun`) are enough, the IDE will assist you adding the required imports:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.0.1.RELEASE'
}

bootJar {
    archiveName = 'app.jar'
    mainClassName = 'com.example.demo.Demo'
}

bootRun {
    main = 'com.example.demo.Demo'
    args '--spring.profiles.active=demo'
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
import org.springframework.boot.gradle.tasks.bundling.BootJar
import org.springframework.boot.gradle.tasks.run.BootRun

plugins {
    id("org.springframework.boot") version "2.0.1.RELEASE"
}

tasks {
    getByName<BootJar>("bootJar") {
        archiveName = "app.jar"
        mainClassName = "com.example.demo.Demo"
    }

    getByName<BootRun>("bootRun") {
        main = "com.example.demo.Demo"
        args("--spring.profiles.active=demo")
    }
}
----


== Creating tasks

Creating tasks can be done on the `tasks` container:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
task greeting {
    doLast { println("Hello, World!") }
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
tasks.create("greeting") {
    doLast { println("Hello, World!") }
}
----

or directly from the top-level using the API functions available on `Project`:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
task greeting {
    doLast { println("Hello, World!") }
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
task("greeting") {
    doLast { println("Hello, World!") }
}
----

or by using Kotlin delegated properties that are useful if you need a reference to the created task for later usage:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
task greeting {
    doLast { println("Hello, World!") }
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
val greeting by tasks.creating {
    doLast { println("Hello, World!") }
}
----


Often you want to create a task of a given type (`Zip` in this example):

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
task docZip(type: Zip) {
    archiveName = 'doc.zip'
    from 'doc'
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
tasks.create<Zip>("docZip") {
    archiveName = "doc.zip"
    from("doc")
}
----

The same can be done using the `Project` API,

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
task docZip(type: Zip) {
    archiveName = 'doc.zip'
    from 'doc'
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
task<Zip>("docZip") {
    archiveName = "doc.zip"
    from("doc")
}
----

or using Kotlin delegated properties:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
task docZip(type: Zip) {
    archiveName = 'doc.zip'
    from 'doc'
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
val docZip by tasks.creating(Zip::class) {
    archiveName = "doc.zip"
    from("doc")
}
----


== Configurations and dependencies

Declaring dependencies in the existing configurations is not much different from doing it in Groovy:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'java'
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt:0.9.0'
    runtimeOnly 'org.postgresql:postgresql'
    testImplementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test') {
        exclude(module: 'junit')
    }
    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine'
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
plugins {
    java
}
dependencies {
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
    implementation("io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt:0.9.0")
    runtimeOnly("org.postgresql:postgresql")
    testImplementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test") {
        exclude(module = "junit")
    }
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine")
}
----

Each configuration contributed by applied plugins is also available as a member of the `configurations` container so you can reference it.

[TIP]
--
**What configurations are available?**

You can ask your IDE for suggestions on the `configurations` container.

You can also use the `:kotlinDslAccessorsReport` task. It prints the Kotlin code for accessing the configurations contributed by applied plugins and provides the name of all of them.
--

Note that if you do not use the `plugins {}` block to apply your plugins, then Kotlin extensions to reference the configurations contributed by the applied plugins won't be available. You'll then have to address them by name:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'java'
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt:0.9.0'
    runtimeOnly 'org.postgresql:postgresql'
    testImplementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test') {
        exclude(module: 'junit')
    }
    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine'
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
apply(plugin = "java")
dependencies {
    "implementation"("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
    "implementation"("io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt:0.9.0")
    "runtimeOnly"("org.postgresql:postgresql")
    "testImplementation"("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test") {
        exclude(module = "junit")
    }
    "testRuntimeOnly"("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine")
}
----

or bring them into scope thanks to Kotlin delegated properties:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'java'
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt:0.9.0'
    runtimeOnly 'org.postgresql:postgresql'
    testImplementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test') {
        exclude(module: 'junit')
    }
    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine'
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
apply(plugin = "java")
val implementation by configurations
val runtimeOnly by configurations
val testImplementation by configurations
val testRuntimeOnly by configurations
dependencies {
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
    implementation("io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt:0.9.0")
    runtimeOnly("org.postgresql:postgresql")
    testImplementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test") {
        exclude(module = "junit")
    }
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine")
}
----


=== Custom configurations and dependencies

Sometimes you need to add your own configuration, and add dependencies to them:

[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
configurations {
    db
    integTestImplementation {
        extendsFrom testImplementation
    }
}

dependencies {
    db 'org.postgresql:postgresql'
    integTestImplementation 'com.ninja-squad:DbSetup:2.1.0'
}
----

[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
val db by configurations.creating
val integTestImplementation by configurations.creating {
    extendsFrom(configurations["testImplementation"])
}

dependencies {
    db("org.postgresql:postgresql")
    integTestImplementation("com.ninja-squad:DbSetup:2.1.0")
}
----

Note that, in the above example, you can only use `db(...)` and `integTestImplementation(...)` because they're both declared as properties before. If they were defined elsewhere, you could get them by delegating to `configurations`, or you could use a string to add a dependency to the configuration:

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
// get the existing testRuntimeOnly configuration
val testRuntimeOnly by configurations

dependencies {
    testRuntimeOnly("org.postgresql:postgresql")
    "db"("org.postgresql:postgresql")
    "integTestImplementation"("com.ninja-squad:DbSetup:2.1.0")
}
----


== Multi project builds

A multi-project build model and configuration are the same whether you use Groovy scripts, Kotlin scripts or a mix of the two:

Let's look at an example.
The following is a settings script declaring some sub projects:

.settings.gradle
[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
include 'core', 'cli'
----
.settings.gradle.kts
[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
include("core", "cli")
----

and the corresponding root project build script configuring sub projects:

.build.gradle
[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
subprojects {
    apply plugin: 'java'
}
project(':cli') {
    apply plugin: 'application'
}
----
.build.gradle.kts
[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
subprojects {
    apply(plugin = "java")
}
project(":cli") {
    apply(plugin = "application")
}
----

[TIP]
Please refer to the link:{user-manual}multi_project_builds.html[Authoring Multi-Project Builds] user manual chapter for more information.

However there are some subtleties that can make your life easier or complicate things with the Kotlin DSL.

In multi project builds, projects get configured top to bottom according to the project hierarchy.
In other words, project build scripts are evaluated top to bottom according to the project hierarchy.

This makes it possible for the Kotlin DSL to make Kotlin extensions to configure plugins applied by a parent project available in a sub project build script, just as if you used the `plugins {}` block directly in the sub project build script.

Following up on our example multi project build, the `:cli` build script would look as follows:

.cli/build.gradle
[source.multi-language-sample, groovy]
----
mainClassName = "com.example.CliMain"
----
.cli/build.gradle.kts
[source.multi-language-sample, kotlin]
----
application {
    mainClassName = "com.example.CliMain"
}
----

[CAUTION]
--
**Configuration on demand**

Enabling the incubating link:{user-manual}multi_project_builds.html#sec:configuration_on_demand[configuration on demand] feature is not recommended as it can lead to very hard to diagnose problems.
The strictness of the Gradle Kotlin DSL makes it even more likely that problems will arise.
In order to save you some trouble you should disable it if you have it enabled.

The same is true with `evaluationDependsOn(projectPath)` and `evaluationDependsOnChildren()`.
Favor link:{user-manual}multi_project_builds.html#sec:decoupled_projects[decoupling your projects] instead.

// TODO note that these will be deprecated soon, for Gradle 5?, need an issue link
--


== Migration strategies

As we've seen above, both scripts using the Kotlin DSL, `\*.gradle.kts`, and scripts using the Groovy DSL, `*.gradle`, can participate in the same build.
Gradle plugins implemented in `./buildSrc`, an included build or externally fetched can use any JVM language.
This makes it possible to migrate progressively, piece by piece, without blocking your team.

At first sight, two approaches come to mind: mechanically migrating your build logic, translating to Kotlin piece by piece, as it is ; or, restructuring your build logic towards Gradle best practices while migrating.

Both approaches are possible.
A mechanical migration will be enough for simple builds.
A complex and highly dynamic build logic may require some restructuring.
A balance between the two approaches often is the right choice.
Of course, applying Gradle best practices will make your builds easier to use and faster and should be favored.

In any case, the more parts of your build logic rely on Groovy dynamism, the harder they will be to use from the Kotlin DSL.
May it be local scripts, local plugins or external plugins relying too much on Groovy dynamism, you'll find recipes on how to cross the dynamic boundaries from static Kotlin in the <<interop>> section below.

There are two key best practices that makes it easier with the static nature of the Kotlin DSL:

* link:{user-manual}plugins.html#sec:plugins_block[Applying plugins with the `plugins {}` DSL]
* link:{user-manual}organizing_build_logic.html#sec:build_sources[Build logic in `buildSrc`].

The former, <<declarative-scripts,explained above>>, is about keeping your build scripts declarative, including using the `pluginManagement {}` DSL in your `settings.gradle.kts` file to use the `plugins {}` DSL with external plugins published without the required metadata.

The later, link:{user-manual}organizing_build_logic.html#sec:build_sources[explained in the Gradle User Manual], is about organizing your build logic into shared local plugins and conventions, easily testable, while providing good IDE support.

=== Kotlin DSL build structure samples

Depending on your build structure you might be interested by the following samples built with the Kotlin DSL:

* the link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}modularity[modularity] sample demonstrates the use of `apply(from = "")` to modularize build scripts,
* the link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}multi-project-with-buildSrc[multi-project-with-buildSrc], link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}multi-kotlin-project[multi-kotlin-project], link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}multi-kotlin-project-with-buildSrc[multi-kotlin-project-with-buildSrc] and link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}multi-kotlin-project-config-injection[multi-kotlin-project-config-injection] samples demonstrate various multi-project build structures,
* the link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}gradle-plugin[gradle-plugin] sample demonstrates a Gradle plugin implemented in Kotlin and taking advantage of the `kotlin-dsl` plugin,
* the link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}composite-builds[composite-builds] sample demonstrates how to use link:{user-manual}composite_builds.html[Composite Builds],
* the link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}source-control[source-control] sample demonstrates how to use external link:https://github.com/gradle/gradle-native/issues/42[source dependencies].

See the samples link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}/README.md[README] for general instructions.


[[interop]]
== Interoperability

When mixing languages in your build logic you may have to cross language boundaries.
An link:https://github.com/gradle/gradle[extreme example] would be a build that uses tasks and plugins implemented in Java, Groovy and Kotlin while mixing build scripts using the Kotlin DSL and the Groovy DSL.

Quoting the Kotlin reference documentation:

> Kotlin is designed with Java Interoperability in mind. Existing Java code can be called from Kotlin in a natural way, and Kotlin code can be used from Java rather smoothly as well.

Both link:link:{kotlin-reference}java-interop.html[calling Java from Kotlin] and link:link:{kotlin-reference}java-to-kotlin-interop.html[calling Kotlin from Java] are very well covered in the Kotlin reference documentation.

The same mostly apply to interoperability with Groovy code.
There are some gotchas though.
The Kotlin DSL also provides with a way to opt-in to Groovy semantics.


=== Static extensions

Both Groovy and Kotlin languages support extending existing classes, respectively with link:http://groovy-lang.org/metaprogramming.html#_extension_modules[Groovy Extension modules] and link:link:{kotlin-reference}extensions.html[Kotlin extensions].

To call a Kotlin extension function from Groovy, call it as a static function passing the receiver as the first parameter:

.build.gradle
[source, groovy]
----
TheKotlinType.kotlinExtensionFunction(receiver, "parameters", 42, aReference)
----

To call a Groovy dynamic extension from Kotlin, the same applies, call it as a static function passing the receiver as the first parameter:

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
TheGroovyTypeExtension.groovyExtensionMethod(receiver, "parameters", 42, aReference)
----


=== Named parameters and default arguments

Both Groovy and Kotlin languages support named function parameters and default arguments.
They are link:link:{kotlin-reference}functions.html#named-arguments[natively] link:link:{kotlin-reference}functions.html#named-arguments[supported] by Kotlin.
Groovy supports link:http://groovy-lang.org/objectorientation.html#_named_arguments[named arguments] in a non type safe way based on a `Map<String, ?>` parameter, thus they cannot be combined with link:http://groovy-lang.org/objectorientation.html#_default_arguments[default arguments].

*When calling Kotlin from Groovy*

To call a Kotlin function with named arguments from Groovy, you can't name arguments, just call the function without naming parameters.

To call a Kotlin function with default arguments from Groovy, always pass all parameters.

*When calling Kotlin from Groovy*

To call a Groovy function with named arguments from Kotlin, you need to pass a `Map<String, ?>`.

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
groovyNamedArgumentTakingMethod(mapOf(
    "parameterName" to "value",
    "other" to 42,
    "and" to aReference))
----

To call a Groovy function with default arguments from Kotlin, always pass all parameters.


=== Groovy Closures from Kotlin

Sometimes, you may have to use Groovy functions taking link:http://groovy-lang.org/closures.html[Closures] from Kotlin code.
Some third party plugins written in Groovy expect that Groovy closures will be passed as arguments.

In order to provide a way to construct closures while preserving Kotlin's strong typing two helper methods exist:

* `closureOf<T> {}`,
* `delegateClosureOf<T> {}`.

Both methods are useful in different circumstances and depend upon the method you are passing the
`Closure` into.
To understand the difference between the two types of closures link:http://groovy-lang.org/closures.html[the Groovy reference documentation] may be helpful.

[NOTE]
Gradle plugins written in any language should prefer the typed `Action<T>` that is automatically mapped to Groovy closures and Kotlin lambdas.

Some plugins expect simple closures, here with the link:{plugin-portal}plugin/com.jfrog.bintray[Bintray] plugin:

[source, kotlin]
----
bintray {
    pkg(closureOf<PackageConfig> {
        // Config for the package here
    })
}
----

In other cases, like with the link:{plugin-portal}plugin/org.gretty[Gretty Plugin] when configuring farms, the plugin expects a delegate closure:

[source, kotlin]
----
farms {
    farm("OldCoreWar", delegateClosureOf<FarmExtension> {
        // Config for the war here
    })
}
----

There sometimes isn't a good way to tell, from looking at the source code, which version to use.
Usually, if you get a `NullPointerException` with `closureOf<T> {}`, using `delegateClosureOf<T> {}`
will resolve the problem.

Also see the link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}groovy-interop[groovy-interop] sample.


=== The Kotlin DSL Groovy Builder

If some plugin makes heavy use of link:http://groovy-lang.org/metaprogramming.html[Groovy meta-programming], then, using it from Kotlin, or Java or any statically compiled language, can be very cumbersome.

The Kotlin DSL provides a `withGroovyBuilder {}` utility extension that brings the Groovy meta-programming semantics on `Any` object.

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
target.withGroovyBuilder {                                          <1>

    // GroovyObject methods available                               <2>
    val foo = getProperty("foo")
    setProperty("foo", "bar")
    invokeMethod("name", "parameters", 42, aReference)

    // Kotlin DSL utilities
    "methodName"("parameters", 42, aReference)                      <3>
    "blockName" {                                                   <4>
        // Same Groovy Builder semantics on `blockName`
    }
    "another"("name" to "example", "url" to "https://example.com/") <5>
}
----
<1> The receiver is a link:http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/api/groovy/lang/GroovyObject.html[GroovyObject] and provides Kotlin helpers
<2> The `GroovyObject` api is available
<3> Invoke the `methodName` method, passing some parameters
<4> Configure the `blockName` property, maps to a `Closure` taking method invocation
<5> Invoke `another` method taking named arguments, maps to a Groovy named arguments `Map<String, ?>` taking method invocation

The link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}maven-plugin[maven-plugin] sample demonstrates the use of the `withGroovyBuilder {}` utility extensions for configuring the `uploadArchives` task to link:{user-manual}maven_plugin.html#sec:deploying_to_a_maven_repository[deploy to a Maven repository] with a custom pom using the Gradle core `maven` plugin.
Note that the recommended `maven-publish` plugin provides a type safe and Kotlin friendly DSL that allows to easily do link:{user-manual}publishing_maven.html#sec:modifying_the_generated_pom[the same and more].

=== Using a Groovy script

Another option is to keep the configuration for that particular plugin in a Groovy DSL build script applied from a Kotlin DSL build script:

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("dynamic-groovy-plugin") version "1.0"               <1>
}
apply(from = "dynamic-groovy-plugin-configuration.gradle")  <2>
----

.dynamic-groovy-plugin-configuration.gradle
[source, groovy]
----
native {                                                    <3>
    dynamic {
        groovy as Usual
    }
}
----
<1> The Kotlin build script requests and applies the plugin
<2> The Kotlin build script applies the Groovy script
<3> The Groovy script uses dynamic Groovy to configure plugin
