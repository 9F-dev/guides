:portal: Gradle Plugin Portal
:plugin: Greeting Plugin
:publishplugin: Plugin Publishing Plugin

Provides a brief introduction to publishing and how it works
Makes concrete statements about what the plugin portal is and isn't

== What you'll build

You will take an exisisting plugin and configure its project so that the plugin is publishable ßto the {portal}.

== What you'll need

* About 25 minutes
* A text editor
* A command prompt
* The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.7 or higher
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or better
* Source code for an existing Gradle plugin. (Preferably your own).

//Describes the process of publishing (on an architectural high-level view)
//
//What's the Plugin Publishing Plugin and how does it function internally?
//
//Using and configuring the Plugin Publishing Plugin

NOTE: If you have never written a plugin, you can look at the https://github.com/gradle-guides/greeting-plugin-example[Greeting Plugin example], but please do not try to publish this to the {portal}. You can also look at {guides}

== Create an account on the {portal}

If you never published a plugin before you need to create a account on the {portal}. This consists of three steps:

. Create an account.
. Create an API key.
. Add your API key to your Gradle configuration.

Firstly go to the https://plugins.gradle.org/user/register[registration page] and create an account.

.Regustration page

Follow the instructions and once you have logged in, you can get your API key via the “API Keys” tab of your profile page.

.API keys is the third tab

It is common practive to place to copy-paste the text into your `$HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties` file, but if you wish you can place it elsewhere. All that the plugin requires is that `gradle.publish.key` and `gradle.publish.secret` are available as project properties when the appropriate Plugin portal tasks are executed.

Once you have the API key you can publish as many plugins as you like.

== Add the {publishplugin} to the project

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::{exampledir}/build.gradle[tags=plugins_block,indent=0]
----

== Configure the {publishplugin}

*TBC: These settings are set for the whole plugin bundle*

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::{exampledir}/build.gradle[tags=plugin_bundle]
----
<1> Everything for the plugin is configured in the `pluginBundle` extension block.
<2> Set the website for your plugin's project
<3> Provide the source repository URI so that others can find it if they want to contribute.

*TBC Transition paragraph to plugins block*

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
pluginBundle {
include::{exampledir}/build.gradle[tags=plugin_definitions,indent=2]
}
----
<1> Each plugin in a bundle is specified in the `plugins` block. As you are only publishing a single plugin at this point there will only be one entry, but should your project publish a bundle in future you will list each of them in here.
<2> The name for each plugin block does not affect the plugin configuration, but they need to be unique for each plugin provided in the `plugins` block.
<3> This is the same identifier specified as the name of plugin properties file that is located in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/gradle-plugins` directory.
<4> Set the plugin name in human-readable form.
<5> Set a description that will be displayed on the portal. Although this is optional it provides useful information to people would might want to use your plugin.
<6> Set tags that might build script authors might use to search for plugin types. This can make your plugin easier to locate.
<7> By default the version from `project.version` will be used, but you can set your own version if required.
