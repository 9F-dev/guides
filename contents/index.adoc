= Building Java 9 Modules

One of the most exciting features of Java 9 is its support for developing and
deploying modular Java software. Gradle doesn't have first-class support for Java 9 modules yet. 

Some https://plugins.gradle.org/search?term=jpms:[community plugins], like https://github.com/java9-modularity/gradle-modules-plugin:[java9-modularity plugin], attempt to add support.  This guide will be updated with more information on how to use built-in Gradle support when it is developed.
