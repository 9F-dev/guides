= Building Kotlin JVM Libraries
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

This guide demonstrates how to create a https://kotlinlang.org[Kotlin] library targeted for the JVM. We'll build a simple API with documentation, write and run tests, and package it all up into a something we can distribute.

It makes sense to use https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl[Gradle's Kotlin DSL] for build scripts since our library and tests are also in Kotlin.

== What you’ll build

You'll create a Kotlin library with the conventional layout, add a test to verify behavior, generate documentation, and publish the library with docs and sources.

If you get stuck at any point, you can check out https://github.com/gradle-guides/building-kotlin-jvm-libraries/tree/master/samples/code/my-kotlin-library[the completed example].

== What you’ll need

 - About +++<span class="time-to-complete-text"></span>+++
 - A text editor or IDE
 - A https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Development Kit] (JDK), version 1.8 or better
 - A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or better

== Step 1: Bootstrap Kotlin project

Let's develop the simplest of libraries with just one API class and method.

=== Create project directory

This is the conventional layout for a Kotlin project. Luckily, Gradle is flexible and would allow us to easily change it by https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html#targeting-the-jvm[adjusting the `sourceSets {}`]. We won't worry about that today, though.

.Kotlin project structure
[source,console]
----
include::{samplesoutputdir}/step-1/tree.out[]
----

The first step is to create a folder for the new project and change directory into it. In a *nix shell this would be:

[source,console]
----
$ mkdir -p my-kotlin-library/src/main/kotlin/org/example
$ cd my-kotlin-library
----

In our new directory we add our library class called `MyLibrary` that returns a value object `Language`.

.src/main/kotlin/org/example/MyLibrary.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/step-1/src/main/kotlin/org/example/MyLibrary.kt[]
----

With the following simple build script we can compile our new Kotlin library.

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/step-1/build.gradle.kts[tags=apply-kotlin-plugin]

include::{samplescodedir}/step-1/build.gradle.kts[tags=configure-dependencies]
----
<1> Apply the Kotlin plugin, targeting the Java VM
<2> Declare a https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.RepositoryHandler.html[dependency repository] on Bintray jcenter
<3> Declare a dependency on the https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/index.html[Kotlin standard library]

We use the `implementation` dependency configuration so that we don't expose any of the Kotlin standard library through our API. This has https://blog.gradle.org/incremental-compiler-avoidance[architectural and performance benefits].

We're nearly ready to start testing and packaging our software.

=== Digging deeper with a build scan

This is not strictly required to complete this guide, but using the https://gradle.com/build-scans#what-are-build-scans[build scan plugin] will be very helpful with understanding what is happening with our builds.

.build.gradle.kts
[source,diff]
----
plugins {
+    `build-scan` // <1>
     kotlin("jvm") version "1.2.31"
}
----
<1> Apply the build scan plugin in the `plugins {}` block at the top.

Add the following build scan configuration below.

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/step-1/build.gradle.kts[tags=configure-build-scan]
----
<1> We will never share your build information, but it's important to read and agree to build scan https://gradle.com/terms-of-service[terms of service].
<2> Configure build scan plugin to create a build scan after all builds.

Now we can compile our project.

.Compile Kotlin sources
[source,console]
----
$ gradle compileKotlin

include::{samplesoutputdir}/step-1/compileKotlin.out[]
----

For example, it is important to know that the Kotlin plugin applies Gradle's Java plugin under the covers (we can see this in the "Plugins" section of the build scan). If we look at the {user-manual}java_plugin.html[docs for the Java plugin], we learn about all of the conventions it applies for things like Javadocs and packaging we'll do later in this guide.

image::build-scan-plugins.png[]

Think of a build scan like a web-based, detailed build report. Super handy for digging into build failures or dependency issues. Let's move on.

== Step 2: Add testing with JUnit

https://junit.org/junit4/[JUnit 4] is the simplest of testing libraries to add to our project. If you happen to prefer the https://spekframework.org/[Spek framework] for Kotlin-based specifications, check out the https://spekframework.org/docs/latest/#_gradle_kotlin_script[Spek docs].

.build.gradle.kts
[source,diff]
----
dependencies {
     implementation(kotlin("stdlib", "1.2.31"))
+    testImplementation("junit:junit:4.12") // <1>
}
----
<1> Add test implementation dependency on JUnit

Now we are ready to add tests for our library. We will follow the Kotlin plugin conventions and put them under `src/test/kotlin`.

.src/test/kotlin/org/example/MyLibraryTest.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/step-2/src/test/kotlin/org/example/MyLibraryTest.kt[]
----

Nothing unexpected here. Now let's run them.

.Execute tests
[source,console]
----
$ gradle test

include::{samplesoutputdir}/step-2/test.out[]
----

Boom. Tests.

== Step 3: Add docs with Dokka

A library isn't done until it's documented. https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka[Dokka] is a popular documentation engine for Kotlin projects. Let's use it.

=== Apply the Dokka plugin

We can declare the Dokka plugin in our `plugins {}` block:

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/step-3/build.gradle.kts[tags=apply-dokka-plugin]
----

=== Configure Dokka plugin

Now we can add configuration down below in our build script.

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/step-3/build.gradle.kts[tags=configure-dokka-plugin]
----
<1> Configure existing Dokka task to output HTML to typical Javadoc directory

There are many more configuration options available for Dokka, documented https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka#using-dokka[here], but this gets the job done for us right now. Let's run it.

.Generate docs with Dokka
[source,console]
----
$ gradle dokka

include::{samplesoutputdir}/step-3/dokka.out[]
----

Dokka complains that we didn't document absolutely everything, but there's enough to get this if we open up `$PROJECT_DIR/build/javadoc/my-kotlin-library/index.html`. Click on the `Language` type and you should see our nice documentation.

=== Generate javadoc JAR

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/step-3/build.gradle.kts[tags=dokka-imports]

include::{samplescodedir}/step-3/build.gradle.kts[tags=configure-dokka-jar]
----
<1> Create dokka Jar task from dokka task output
<2> `dependsOn(dokka)` not needed; dependency automatically inferred by from(dokka)

Try running `gradle dokkaJar` and see if you can find the javadoc JAR based on what you know so far.

We could optionally also generate a `"sources"` JAR using the same pattern from `java.sourceSets["main"].allSource`.

== Step 4: Publish to local repo

Now our library is ready to share with the world. We're going to publish it locally with the {user-manual}publishing_maven.html[maven-publish plugin] just to keep things simple, but another popular choice is the https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.jfrog.bintray[Gradle Bintray Plugin]. Their documentation has https://github.com/bintray/bintray-examples/tree/master/gradle-bintray-plugin-examples[several samples] you can use if you're interested.

=== Apply the maven-publish plugin

.build.gradle.kts
[source,diff]
----
plugins {
     `build-scan`
+    `maven-publish`
     kotlin("jvm") version "1.2.31"
}
----

=== Set project coordinates

Let us specify our project coordinates as `org.example:my-kotlin-library:0.0.1` in our build script for publishing.

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/step-4/build.gradle.kts[tags=project-coordinates]
----

The project name is set by the root project directory name by default, but it is best practice to make it explicit. This is done in a `settings.gradle.kts` file at the project root.

.settings.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/step-4/settings.gradle.kts[]
----

=== Configure Maven publication

For the `maven-publish` plugin to have any effect, a https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.publish.maven.MavenPublication.html[MavenPublication] must be added to the set of publications. This publication determines which artifacts are actually published as well as the details included in the associated POM file.

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----

include::{samplescodedir}/step-4/build.gradle.kts[tags=publishing-imports]

include::{samplescodedir}/step-4/build.gradle.kts[tags=configure-publishing]
----
<1> Create a Maven publication called "default" from the "java" component
<2> Declare the javadoc JAR from Dokka as an artifact
<3> Declare a local Maven repository under the `build/` directory

Now we are ready to `publish`!

.Publish to local repository
[source,console]
----
$ gradle publish

include::{samplesoutputdir}/step-4/publish.out[]
----

Your Maven repository should now have the published artifacts.

.Local Maven repository
[source,console]
----
include::{samplesoutputdir}/step-4/repo.out[]
----
