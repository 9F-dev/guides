= Running Webpack with Gradle

Many web applications are built today with distinctly different server-side and client-side technologies. In order to run these applications, both server-side and client-side sources must be built and packaged. Webpack has emerged as the tool of choice among JavaScript developers for bundling client-side assets.

Tradeoffs are inherent in any engineering decision, but using disjointed tools can slow down very capable development teams. Gradle provides mechanisms to integrate with everything, even Webpack and other JavaScript development tools. More information about managing Webpack with Gradle (including hot reloading) is covered in an in-depth topical guide (coming soon).

This guide will start you down a path that leverages the benefits of both Gradle and https://webpack.js.org/[Webpack] with minimal overhead.

== What you'll build

You will create a Gradle task that bundles web assets with https://webpack.js.org/[Webpack] in a way that leverages Gradle's https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/more_about_tasks.html#sec:up_to_date_checks[up-to-date checks] and https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html[build cache].

== What you'll need

* About +++<span class="time-to-complete-text"></span>+++
* A text editor or IDE
* The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.7 or higher
* Node.js, version 8.0 or higher
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version 4.0 or better

== Step 1: Create sample project and install dependencies

Setup a trivial web application by running these commands and copying sources to the files listed.

=== Step 1.1: Create sample project

NOTE: This demo project is derived from https://webpack.js.org/guides/get-started/[Webpack's Getting Started Guide]. Learn more Webpack usage at https://webpack.js.org/guides/.

[listing]
----
$ mkdir -p gradle-webpack-demo/app
$ cd gradle-webpack-demo
----

.app/index.js
[source,javascript]
----
import _ from 'lodash';

function component () {
  var element = document.createElement('div');

  /* lodash is required for the next line to work */
  element.innerHTML = _.join(['Build', 'together;', 'not', 'alone'], ' ');

  return element;
}

document.body.appendChild(component());
----

.index.html
[source,html]
----
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Gradle + Webpack Demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="build/js/bundle.js"></script> // <1>
  </body>
</html>
----
<1> Webpack-generated JS bundle will include index.js and lodash

=== Step 1.2: Install Webpack and lodash

[listing]
----
$ npm init -y
$ npm install --save lodash@~4
$ npm install --save-dev webpack@~2
----

Once completed successfully, your project structure should look like this:
[listing]
----
.
├── app
│   └── index.js
├── index.html
├── node_modules
│   └── lodash
│   └── webpack
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
----

NOTE: package-lock.json is present only for npm v5+, which is a recommended upgrade.

== Step 2: Use an Exec Task

Command-line tools can be invoked through Gradle https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.Exec.html[Exec] tasks.

NOTE: https://guides.gradle.org/writing-gradle-tasks/[Custom Task Classes] are highly recommended for any applications where configuration or reusability is desired; for example, to allow dev (debug with sourcemaps) and production variants.

=== Step 2.1: Create Gradle task

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
task webpack(type: Exec) { // <1>
    commandLine "$projectDir/node_modules/.bin/webpack", "app/index.js", "$buildDir/js/bundle.js"
}
----
<1> Declare an Exec task to invoke `webpack`

.Executing the `webpack` task
----
$ gradle webpack

> Task :webpack
Hash: cebd0a554d64bf1868af
Version: webpack 2.6.1
Time: 406ms
    Asset    Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
bundle.js  544 kB       0  [emitted]  [big]  main
   [0] ./~/lodash/lodash.js 540 kB {0} [built]
   [1] ./app/index.js 269 bytes {0} [built]
   [2] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 509 bytes {0} [built]
   [3] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 517 bytes {0} [built]


BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
1 actionable task: 1 executed
----

You can now open `index.html` and see "Build together; not alone".


== Step 3: Declare task inputs and outputs

You are now able to execute Webpack through Gradle. Let's move on to only running Webpack when you _need_ to, through Gradle's https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/more_about_tasks.html#sec:up_to_date_checks[up-to-date checks] (AKA incremental build).

In order to take advantage of up-to-date checks, you must declare the inputs and outputs of your task. Change your task configuration in your Gradle build this way:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
task webpack(type: Exec) {
    inputs.file("package-lock.json") // <1>
    inputs.dir("app")
    // NOTE: Add inputs.file("webpack.config.js") for projects that have it
    outputs.dir("$buildDir/js")      // <2>

    commandLine "$projectDir/node_modules/.bin/webpack", "app/index.js", "$buildDir/js/bundle.js"
}
----
<1> Declare `package-lock.json` and everything under `app/` as an input
<2> Declare `build/js` as the output location

Execute `gradle webpack` to verify your configuration. We have changed the declared task inputs and outputs, so `webpack` will be run.

Now executing `gradle webpack` with no changes to web assets won't unnecessarily invoke Webpack:

[listing]
----
$ gradle webpack

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 0s
1 actionable task: 1 up-to-date // <1>
----
<1> Gradle recognizes when JS sources haven't been changed. `webpack` bundles are `UP-TO-DATE` and don't need to be generated


== Step 4: Leverage Gradle Build Cache

As of Gradle 4.0, Gradle can avoid work that has already been done on different VCS branches or by other machines via the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html[Build Cache].

Suppose someone else pushed JS changes that were subsequently built by CI and shared in a remote build cache. If you have the same Webpack config and no JS changes, you can avoid re-bundling JS via Webpack and download the bundles straight from the build cache, thus saving your build's bundling time.

=== Step 4.1: Make webpack task cacheable

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
task webpack(type: Exec) {
    inputs.file("package-lock.json").withPathSensitivity(PathSensitivity.RELATIVE) // <1>
    inputs.dir("app").withPathSensitivity(PathSensitivity.RELATIVE)
    outputs.dir("$buildDir/js")
    outputs.cacheIf { true } // <2>

    commandLine "$projectDir/node_modules/.bin/webpack", "app/index.js", "$buildDir/js/bundle.js"
}
----
<1> Declare that inputs should be snapshotted with relative file references.
<2> Always cache this task's outputs. This requires that the build cache is enabled.

It is strongly advised to use a https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_tasks.html[custom task class] when writing cacheable tasks. An example of one for Webpack is provided in the Managing JavaScript topical guide (coming soon). Furthermore, you may want to declare property names for better diagnostics.

=== Step 4.2: Run `webpack` to populate Gradle Build Cache

[listing]
----
$ gradle webpack --build-cache // <1>
Build cache is an incubating feature.
Using local directory build cache for the root build (location = ~/.gradle/caches/build-cache-1).

> Task :webpack
Hash: cebd0a554d64bf1868af
Version: webpack 2.6.1
Time: 411ms
····Asset    Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
bundle.js  544 kB       0  [emitted]  [big]  main
···[0] ./~/lodash/lodash.js 540 kB {0} [built]
···[1] ./app/index.js 269 bytes {0} [built]
···[2] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 509 bytes {0} [built]
···[3] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 517 bytes {0} [built]


BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
----
<1> Enable Gradle Build Cache. Can also use `org.gradle.cache=true` in `gradle.properties`

=== Step 4.3: Make a small JavaScript change

Comment out a line or make some other trivial change.

.app/index.js
[source,diff]
----
-  element.innerHTML = _.join(['Build', 'together;', 'not', 'alone'], ' ');
+  // element.innerHTML = _.join(['Build', 'together;', 'not', 'alone'], ' ');
----

=== Step 4.4: Re-run `webpack` to bundle changes

[listing]
----
$ gradle webpack --build-cache
Build cache is an incubating feature.
Using local directory build cache for the root build (location = ~/.gradle/caches/build-cache-1).

> Task :webpack
Hash: f86580c7ddca3e9d092a
Version: webpack 2.6.1
Time: 413ms
    Asset    Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
bundle.js  544 kB       0  [emitted]  [big]  main
   [0] ./~/lodash/lodash.js 540 kB {0} [built]
   [1] ./app/index.js 287 bytes {0} [built]
   [2] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 509 bytes {0} [built]
   [3] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 517 bytes {0} [built]


BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
1 actionable task: 1 executed
----

=== Step 4.5: "reset" changes

Uncomment to undo changes we made.

.app/index.js
[source,diff]
----
-  // element.innerHTML = _.join(['Build', 'together;', 'not', 'alone'], ' ');
+  element.innerHTML = _.join(['Build', 'together;', 'not', 'alone'], ' ');
----

=== Step 4.6: Resolve JS bundle from build cache

[listing]
----
$ gradle --build-cache webpack
Build cache is an incubating feature.
Using local directory build cache for the root build (location = ~/.gradle/caches/build-cache-1).

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
1 actionable task: 1 from cache // <1>
----
<1> `webpack` was not executed. `build/js/bundle.js` was loaded from the build cache instead.

Even though you just made changes, re-bundling is not necessary. This same mechanism works well when switching git branches and other common development workflows. It works even better when you can https://gradle.com/build-cache[reuse outputs from remote builds].

== Next Steps
Congratulations! You now have a Gradle task that executes Webpack, but only when web assets change. The benefits of using Gradle increase as your project grows.

Chances are, your needs are more complex. If so, the topical guide Managing JavaScript with Gradle (coming soon) is for you. Happy bundling!
