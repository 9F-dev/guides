= Creating Multi-project Builds


== What you'll build


== What you'll need

* About NN minutes
* A text editor
* A command prompt
* The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.7 or higher
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or better

== Step 1

The first step is to create a folder for the new project and add a {user-manual}gradle_wrapper.html#sec:wrapper_generation[Gradle Wrapper] to the project. If you use the Build Init plugin then the necessary `settings.gradle` and `build.gradle` will also be added.

$ mkdir creating-multi-project-builds
$ cd creating-multi-project-builds
$ gradle init // <1> <2>

:wrapper
:init

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----
<1> Use of `init` will create skeleton `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle` files which can be customised.
<2> This also allows a version of Gradle to be locked to a project and henceforth you can use `./gradlew` instead of `gradle`.
