This guide will walk you through converting your Groovy-based Gradle build scripts to Kotlin.

Gradle's newer Kotlin DSL provides a pleasant editing experience in supported IDEs: content-assist, refactoring, documentation, and more.

Please also read the link:{user-manual}kotlin_dsl.html[Gradle Kotlin DSL Primer] in the Gradle user manual to learn the specificities, limitations and usage of the Gradle Kotlin DSL.

The rest of the Gradle link:{user-manual}userguide.html[user manual] and link:{guides}[guides] contain build script excerpts that demonstrate both the Groovy DSL and the Kotlin DSL.
This is the best place where to find how to do this and what with each DSL ; and it covers all Gradle features from link:{user-manual}plugins.html[using plugins] to link:{user-manual}customizing_dependency_resolution_behavior.html[customizing the dependency resolution behavior].

== Before you start migrating

**Please read:** It's helpful to understand the following important information _before you migrate_:

* Using the latest versions of Gradle, applied plugins, and your IDE should be your first move.
* Kotlin DSL is fully supported in Intellij IDEA and Android Studio. Other IDEs, such as Eclipse or NetBeans, do not yet provide helpful tools for editing Gradle Kotlin DSL files, however, importing and working with Kotlin DSL-based builds work as usual.
* In IntelliJ IDEA, you must link:https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import[import your project from the Gradle model] to get content-assist and refactoring tools for Kotlin DSL scripts.
* There are some situations where the Kotlin DSL is slower. First use, on clean checkouts or ephemeral CI agents for example, link:{kotlin-dsl-issues}902[are known to be slower].
The same applies to the scenario in which something in the _buildSrc_ directory changes, which invalidates build-script caching.
Builds with slow configuration time might affect the IDE responsiveness, please check out the link:https://guides.gradle.org/performance/#configuration[performance guide].
* You must run Gradle with Java 8 or higher. Java 7 is not supported.
* The embedded Kotlin compiler is known to work on Linux, macOS, Windows, Cygwin, FreeBSD and Solaris on x86-64 architectures.
* Knowledge of Kotlin syntax and basic language features is very helpful. The link:{kotlin-reference}[Kotlin reference documentation] and link:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html[Kotlin Koans] should be useful to you.
* Use of the `plugins {}` block to declare Gradle plugins significantly improves the editing experience, and is highly recommended. Consider adopting it in your Groovy build scripts before converting them to Kotlin.
* The Kotlin DSL will not support `model {}` elements. This is part of the link:https://blog.gradle.org/state-and-future-of-the-gradle-software-model[discontinued Gradle Software Model].
* Enabling the incubating link:{user-manual}multi_project_builds.html#sec:configuration_on_demand[configuration on demand] feature is not recommended as it can lead to very hard-to-diagnose problems.

Read more in the link:{user-manual}kotlin_dsl.html[Gradle Kotlin DSL Primer].

If you run to trouble or a suspected bug, please take advantage of the `gradle/kotlin-dsl` link:{kotlin-dsl-issues}[issue tracker].

_You don't have to migrate all at once!_ Both Groovy and Kotlin-based build scripts can `apply` other scripts of either language. You can find inspiration for any Gradle features not covered in the link:https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/tree/master/samples[Kotlin DSL samples].


== Prepare your Groovy scripts

Some simple Kotlin and Groovy language differences can make converting scripts tedious:

* Groovy strings can be quoted with single quotes `'string'` or double quotes `"string"` whereas Kotlin requires double quotes `"string"`.
* Groovy allows to omit parentheses when invoking functions whereas Kotlin always requires the parentheses.
* The Gradle Groovy DSL allows to omit the `=` assignment operator when assigning properties whereas Kotlin always requires the assignment operator.

As a first migration step, it is recommended to prepare your Groovy build scripts by

* unifying quotes using double quotes,
* disambiguating function invocations and property assignments (using respectively parentheses and assignment operator).

The former can easily be done by searching for `'` and replacing by `"`.
For example,

[.multi-language-sample]
====
.build.gradle
=====
[source,groovy]
----
group 'com.acme'
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.acme:example:1.0'
}
----
=====
====

becomes:

[.multi-language-sample]
====
.build.gradle
=====
[source,groovy]
----
group "com.acme"
dependencies {
    implementation "com.acme:example:1.0"
}
----
=====
====

The latter is a bit more involved as it may not be trivial to distinguish function invocations and property assignments in a Groovy script.
A good strategy is to make all ambiguous statements property assignments first and then fix the build by turning the failing ones to function invocations.

For example,

[.multi-language-sample]
====
.build.gradle
=====
[source,groovy]
----
group "com.acme"
dependencies {
    implementation "com.acme:example:1.0"
}
----
=====
====

becomes:

[.multi-language-sample]
====
.build.gradle
=====
[source,groovy]
----
group = "com.acme"                          // <1>
dependencies {
    implementation("com.acme:example:1.0")  // <2>
}
----
=====
====
<1> Property assignment
<2> Function invocation

While staying valid Groovy, it is now unambiguous and close to the Kotlin syntax, making it easier to then rename the script to turn it into a Gradle Kotlin DSL script.


== Script file naming

[NOTE]
--
Groovy DSL script files use the `.gradle` file name extension.

Kotlin DSL script files use the `.gradle.kts` file name extension.
--

To use the Kotlin DSL, simply name your files `build.gradle.kts` instead of `build.gradle`.

The link:{user-manual}build_lifecycle.html#sec:settings_file[settings file], `settings.gradle`, can also be renamed `settings.gradle.kts`.

In a multi-project build, you can have some modules using the Groovy DSL (with `build.gradle`) and others using the Kotlin DSL (with `build.gradle.kts`).

On top of that, apply the following conventions for better IDE support:

* Name scripts that are applied to `Settings` according to the pattern `*.settings.gradle.kts`,
* Name link:{user-manual}init_scripts.html[init scripts] according to the pattern `*.init.gradle.kts`.


== Applying plugins

Just like with the Groovy DSL, there are two ways to apply Gradle plugins:

- declaratively, using the `plugins {}` block,
- imperatively, using the `apply(..)` functions.

Here's an example using the declarative `plugins {}` block:

====
include::sample[dir="applying-plugins/declarative/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="applying-plugins/declarative/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

The Kotlin DSL provides property extensions for all link:{user-manual}standard_plugins.html[Gradle core plugins],
as shown above with the `java`, `jacoco` or `maven-publish` declaration.

Third party plugins can be applied the same way as with the Groovy DSL. Except for the double quotes and parentheses.
You can also apply core plugins with that style. But the statically-typed accessors are recommended since they are
type-safe and will be autocompleted by your IDE.

You can also use the imperative `apply` syntax, but then non-core plugins must be included on the classpath of the build script:

====
include::sample[dir="applying-plugins/imperative/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="applying-plugins/imperative/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

[NOTE]
--
**We strongly recommend that you use the `plugins {}` block in preference to the `apply()` function.**

The declarative nature of the `plugins {}` block enables the Kotlin DSL to provide type-safe accessors to the extensions, configurations and other features contributed by the applied plugins, which makes it easy for IDEs to discover the details of the plugins' models and makes them easy to configure.
--


[[configuring-plugins]]
== Configuring plugins

Many plugins come with extensions to configure them. If those plugins are applied using the declarative `plugins {}` block, then Kotlin extension functions are made available to configure their extension, the same way as in Groovy.
The following sample shows how this works for the Jacoco Plugin.

====
include::sample[dir="configuring-plugins/declaratively-applied/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="configuring-plugins/declaratively-applied/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

By contrast, if you use the imperative `apply()` function to apply a plugin, then you will have to use the `configure<T>()` function to configure that plugin.
The following sample shows how this works for the Checkstyle Plugin by explicitly declaring the plugin's extension class — `CheckstyleExtension` — in the `configure<T>()` function:

====
include::sample[dir="configuring-plugins/imperatively-applied/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="configuring-plugins/imperatively-applied/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

Again, we strongly recommend that you apply plugins declaratively via the `plugins {}` block.

[TIP]
.Knowing what plugin-provided extensions are available
--
Because your IDE knows about the configuration elements that a plugin provides, it will include those elements when you ask your IDE for suggestions.
This will happen both at the top level of your build scripts — most plugin extensions are added to the `Project` object — and within an extension's configuration block.

You can also run the `:kotlinDslAccessorsReport` task to learn about the extensions contributed by all applied plugins.
It prints the Kotlin code you can use to access those extensions and provides the name and type of the accessor methods.
--

If the plugin you want to configure relies on `groovy.lang.Closure` in its method signatures or uses other dynamic Groovy semantics, more work will be required to configure that plugin from a Kotlin DSL build script.
See the link:{user-manual}kotlin_dsl.html#sec:interoperability[interoperability section of the Gradle Kotlin DSL documentation] for more information on how to call Groovy code from Kotlin code or to keep that plugin's configuration in a Groovy script.

Plugins also contribute tasks that you may want to configure directly.
This topic is covered in the <<configuring-tasks>> section.


[[declarative-scripts]]
== Keeping build scripts declarative

Plugins fetched from a source other than the link:{plugin-portal}[Gradle Plugin Portal] may or may not be usable with the `plugins {}` block.
It depends on how they have been published.

For example, the Android Plugin for Gradle is not published to the Gradle Plugin Portal and at least up to version 3.1.0 of the plugin, the metadata required to resolve the artifacts for a given plugin identifier  is not published to the Google repository.

Because of this, projects typically apply the plugin via a `buildscript {}` block and the `apply()` function.
However, you _can_ use the `plugins {}` block if you configure your project appropriately.
We will show you in this section how to do that for the Android Plugin for Gradle.

[NOTE]
When publishing plugins, please use Gradle's built-in link:{user-manual}java_gradle_plugin.html[Java Gradle Plugin] Plugin. It automates the publication of the metadata necessary to make your plugins usable with the `plugins {}` block.

The goal is to instruct your build on how to map the `com.android.application` plugin identifier to a resolvable artifact.
This is done in two steps:

 * Add a plugin repository to the build's settings file
 * Map the plugin ID to the corresponding artifact coordinates

The following example shows you how to add a plugin repository to the build via a `pluginManagement {}` block in the settings file:

====
include::sample[dir="declarative-scripts/declarative-android",files="settings.gradle.kts[tags=repo]"]
====

Providing the ID-to-artifact mapping is also done in the settings file, again within the `pluginManagement {}` block.
The following sample maps the `com.android.application` ID to the `com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>` artifact coordinate:

====
include::sample[dir="declarative-scripts/declarative-android",files="settings.gradle.kts[tags=plugin]"]
====

Once you have completed both steps, you can apply the plugin using the `plugins {}` block and benefit from the type-safe plugin extension accessors in your build files:

====
include::sample[dir="declarative-scripts/declarative-android",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====
<1> Declaratively request the `com.android.application` plugin
<2> Configure the `android` extension using Kotlin DSL type safe accessor

See the link:{user-manual}plugins.html#sec:plugin_management[Plugin Management] section of the Gradle user manual for more information.

The same approach can be used to resolve plugins from composite builds, which link:https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/2528[do not expose plugin markers] yet.
Simply map the plugin ID to the corresponding artifact coordinates as shown in the Android samples above.


[[configuration-avoidance]]
== Configuration avoidance

Gradle 4.9 introduced a new API for creating and configuring tasks in build scripts and plugins. The intent is for this new API to eventually replace the existing API.

[quote]
____
One of the major differences between the existing and new Gradle Tasks API is whether or not Gradle spends the time to create `Task` instances and run configuration code. The new API allows Gradle to delay or completely avoid configuring tasks that will never be executed in a build. For example, when compiling code, Gradle does not need to configure tasks that run tests.
____

See the link:https://blog.gradle.org/preview-avoiding-task-configuration-time[_Evolving the Gradle API to reduce configuration time_] blog post and the link:{user-manual}task_configuration_avoidance.html[Task Configuration Avoidance] chapter in the user manual for more information.

The Gradle Kotlin DSL embraces the new API by providing DSL constructs to make it easier to use. Rest assured, the whole Gradle API remains available.

[TIP]
If your Groovy build logic is not using the new API, doing the migration to Kotlin and to the new API in distinct steps will make it easier to validate the build behavior.

The following two sections will demonstrate both lazy and eager task creation and configuration.


[[configuring-tasks]]
== Configuring tasks

The syntax for configuring tasks is where the Groovy and Kotlin DSLs start to differ significantly.
Since Kotlin is a statically typed language, you need to know and provide the type of the task if you want to access any of its type-specific properties and methods.

You also can't access the task directly as a property of the build script as you can in a Groovy build script. Instead, you query the `tasks` collection by name and type, as demonstrated in the following sample:

.Using the configuration avoidance API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=single-lazy]"]
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=single-lazy]"]
====

.Using the eager API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=single-eager]"]
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=single-eager]"]
====

[NOTE]
Note that it's necessary to specify the type of the task explicitly. Otherwise, the script won't compile because the inferred type will be `Task`, not `Jar`, and the `archiveName` property is specific to the `Jar` task type.

You can, however, omit the type if you only need to configure properties or call methods that are common to all tasks, i.e. they are declared on the `Task` interface:

.Using the configuration avoidance API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=untyped-lazy]"]
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=untyped-lazy]"]
====

.Using the eager API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=untyped-eager]"]
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=untyped-eager]"]
====

If you need to configure several properties or call multiple methods on the same task, you can group them in a block as follows:

.Using the configuration avoidance API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=config-lazy]"]
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=config-lazy]"]
====

.Using the eager API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=config-eager]"]
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/basics/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=config-eager]"]
====

Once the task type is declared, the IDE can assist you in configuring the task with suggestions and by providing access to the task's source.

[TIP]
.Knowing the type of a task
--
If you don't know what type a task has, then you can find that information out via the built-in `help` task.
Simply pass it the name of the task you're interested in using the `--task` option, like so:

[source]
----
❯ ./gradlew help --task jar
...
Type
     Jar (org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar)
----
--

Let's bring all this together by running through a quick worked example that configures the `bootJar` and `bootRun` tasks of a Spring Boot project.
We first determine the types of those tasks via the `help` task:

[source]
----
❯ ./gradlew help --task bootJar
...
Type
     BootJar (org.springframework.boot.gradle.tasks.bundling.BootJar)
----

[source]
----
❯ ./gradlew help --task bootRun
...
Type
     BootRun (org.springframework.boot.gradle.tasks.run.BootRun)
----

Now that we know the types of the two tasks, we can import the relevant types — `BootJar` and `BootRun` — and configure the tasks as required.
Note that the IDE can assist us with the required imports, so we only need the simple names, i.e. without the full packages.
Here's the resulting build script, complete with imports:

.Using the configuration avoidance API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/spring-boot/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=lazy]"]
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/spring-boot/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=lazy]"]
====

.Using the eager API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/spring-boot/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=eager]"]
include::sample[dir="configuring-tasks/spring-boot/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=eager]"]
====


== Creating tasks

Creating tasks can be done using the script top-level method named `task(...)`:

.Using the eager API & DSL only
====
include::sample[dir="creating-tasks/project/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="creating-tasks/project/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

Registering or creating tasks can also be done on the `tasks` container, respectively using the `register(...)` and `create(...)` methods as shown here:

.Using the configuration avoidance API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="creating-tasks/tasks-lazy/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=container-api]"]
include::sample[dir="creating-tasks/tasks-lazy/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=container-api]"]
====

.Using the eager API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="creating-tasks/tasks-eager/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=container-api]"]
include::sample[dir="creating-tasks/tasks-eager/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=container-api]"]
====

The samples above create untyped, ad-hoc tasks, but you will more commonly want to create tasks of a specific type.
This can also be done using the same `create()` and `creating()` methods.
Here's an example that creates a new task of type `Zip`:

.Using the configuration avoidance API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="creating-tasks/tasks-lazy/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=typed-container-api]"]
include::sample[dir="creating-tasks/tasks-lazy/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=typed-container-api]"]
====

.Using the eager API & DSL
====
include::sample[dir="creating-tasks/tasks-eager/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=typed-container-api]"]
include::sample[dir="creating-tasks/tasks-eager/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=typed-container-api]"]
====


[[configurations-and-dependencies]]
== Configurations and dependencies

Declaring dependencies in existing configurations is similar to the way it's done in Groovy build scripts, as you can see in this example:

====
include::sample[dir="configurations-and-dependencies/declarative/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="configurations-and-dependencies/declarative/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

Each configuration contributed by an applied plugin is also available as a member of the `configurations` container, so you can reference it just like any other configuration.

[TIP]
.Knowing what configurations are available
--
The easiest way to find out what configurations are available is by asking your IDE for suggestions within the `configurations` container.

You can also use the `:kotlinDslAccessorsReport` task, which prints the Kotlin code for accessing the configurations contributed by applied plugins and provides the names for all of those accessors.
--

Note that if you do not use the `plugins {}` block to apply your plugins, then you won't be able to configure the dependency configurations provided by those plugins in the usual way. Instead, you will have to use string literals for the configuration names, which means you won't get IDE support:

====
include::sample[dir="configurations-and-dependencies/imperative/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="configurations-and-dependencies/imperative/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=string-invoke]"]
====

This is just one more reason to use the `plugins {}` block whenever you can!

=== Custom configurations and dependencies

Sometimes you need to create your own configurations and attach dependencies to them.
The following example declares two new configurations:

 * `db`, to which we add a PostgreSQL dependency
 * `integTestImplementation`, which is configured to extend the `testImplementation` configuration and to which we add a different dependency

====
include::sample[dir="configurations-and-dependencies/custom/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=custom]"]
include::sample[dir="configurations-and-dependencies/custom/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=delegated-properties]"]
====

Note that we can only use the `db(...)` and `integTestImplementation(...)` notation within the `dependencies {}` block in the above example because both configurations are declared as delegated properties beforehand via the `creating()` method.
If the configurations were defined elsewhere, you could only reference them either by first creating delegating properties via `configurations`  — as opposed to `configurations.creating()` — or by using string literals within the `dependencies {}` block.
The following example demonstrates both approaches:

====
include::sample[dir="configurations-and-dependencies/custom/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=string-reference]"]
====


== Multi-project builds

The link:{user-manual}multi_project_builds.html[model for multi-project builds] is the same regardless of whether the projects within them have Groovy DSL or Kotlin DSL build scripts.
Multi-project builds can even have a mix of the two.

As you can see from the following settings file and build script, the Kotlin syntax is very similar to the Groovy one:

====
include::sample[dir="multi-project-builds/groovy",files="settings.gradle[];build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="multi-project-builds/kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[];build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

However there are some subtleties that can make your life easier or complicate things with the Kotlin DSL.

In multi project builds, projects get configured top to bottom according to the project hierarchy.
In other words, project build scripts are evaluated top to bottom according to the project hierarchy.

This makes it possible for the Kotlin DSL to make Kotlin extensions to configure plugins applied by a parent project available in a sub project build script, just as if you used the `plugins {}` block directly in the sub project build script.

Following up on our example multi project build, the `:cli` build script would look as follows:

====
include::sample[dir="multi-project-builds/groovy",files="cli/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="multi-project-builds/kotlin",files="cli/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====


== Migration strategies

As we've seen above, both scripts using the Kotlin DSL and those using the Groovy DSL can participate in the same build.
In addition, Gradle plugins from the _buildSrc_ directory, an included build or an external location can be implemented using any JVM language.
This makes it possible to migrate a build progressively, piece by piece, without blocking your team.

Two approaches to migrations stand out:

 * Migrating the existing syntax of your build to Kotlin, bit by bit, while retaining the structure — what we call a _mechanical migration_
 * Restructuring your build logic towards Gradle best practices and switching to Kotlin DSL as part of that effort

Both approaches are viable.
A mechanical migration will be enough for simple builds.
A complex and highly dynamic build may require some restructuring anyway, so in such cases reimplementing build logic to follow Gradle best practice makes sense.

Since applying Gradle best practices will make your builds easier to use and faster, we recommend that you migrate all projects in that way eventually, but it makes sense to focus on the projects that have to be restructured first and those that would benefit most from the improvements.

Also consider that the more parts of your build logic rely on the dynamic aspects of Groovy, the harder they will be to use from the Kotlin DSL.
You'll find recipes on how to cross the dynamic boundaries from static Kotlin in the link:{user-manual}kotlin_dsl.html#sec:interoperability[interoperability section of the Gradle Kotlin DSL documentation], regardless of where the dynamic Groovy build logic resides.

There are two key best practices that make it easier to work within the static context of the Kotlin DSL:

 * Using the `plugins {}` block
 * Putting local build logic in the build's _buildSrc_ directory

The `plugins {}` block — link:{user-manual}plugins.html#sec:plugins_block[explained in the Gradle User Manual] — is about keeping your build scripts declarative in order to get the best out of the Kotlin DSL.
You saw <<declarative-scripts,above>> how to apply this practice even with external plugins published without the required metadata.

Utilizing the _buildSrc_ project — also link:{user-manual}organizing_gradle_projects.html#sec:build_sources[explained in the Gradle User Manual] — is about organizing your build logic into shared local plugins and conventions that are easily testable and provide good IDE support.

=== Kotlin DSL build structure samples

Depending on your build structure you might be interested in the following samples built with the Kotlin DSL:

* The link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}modularity[modularity] sample demonstrates the use of `apply(from = "")` to modularize build scripts.
* The link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}multi-project-with-buildSrc[multi-project-with-buildSrc], link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}multi-kotlin-project[multi-kotlin-project], link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}multi-kotlin-project-with-buildSrc[multi-kotlin-project-with-buildSrc] and link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}multi-kotlin-project-config-injection[multi-kotlin-project-config-injection] samples demonstrate various multi-project build structures.
* The link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}gradle-plugin[gradle-plugin] sample demonstrates a Gradle plugin implemented in Kotlin and taking advantage of the `kotlin-dsl` plugin.
* The link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}composite-builds[composite-builds] sample demonstrates how to use link:{user-manual}composite_builds.html[Composite Builds].
* The link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}source-control[source-control] sample demonstrates how to use external link:https://github.com/gradle/gradle-native/issues/42[source dependencies].

See the samples link:{kotlin-dsl-samples}/README.md[README] for general instructions.


[[interop]]
== Interoperability

When mixing languages in your build logic, you may have to cross language boundaries.
An extreme example would be a build that uses tasks and plugins that are implemented in Java, Groovy and Kotlin, while also using both Kotlin DSL and Groovy DSL build scripts.

Quoting the Kotlin reference documentation:

> Kotlin is designed with Java Interoperability in mind. Existing Java code can be called from Kotlin in a natural way, and Kotlin code can be used from Java rather smoothly as well.

Both link:{kotlin-reference}java-interop.html[calling Java from Kotlin] and link:{kotlin-reference}java-to-kotlin-interop.html[calling Kotlin from Java] are very well covered in the Kotlin reference documentation.

The same mostly applies to interoperability with Groovy code.
In addition, the Kotlin DSL provides several ways to opt into Groovy semantics.

== Summary

In this guide you had a tour of the main differences between Gradle's Groovy DSL and Kotlin DSL by comparing build scripts doing common things, while being introduced to the main idioms of the Kotlin DSL.
You also took a look at possible migration strategies in the light of the structure of builds.
Last, but not least, you learnt how the two DSLs inter-operate.
