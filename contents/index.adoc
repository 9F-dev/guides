= Using the Build Cache

////
Write your content using a selection of section levels as you wish.
You can also use include blocks to split your topical guide into more manageable
chunks. Have a look in build.gradle to see which attributes are already available
to use. This should among others include {user-manual}, {guides}, {gradle-version}.
