== Summary
You learned about the two ways Gradle can avoid work and we showed you the concepts which make up a build which is effectively using task output caching.
You should now have the knowledge to adapt your own build so it can make effective use of the build cache.
By doing so, you will improve incremental build performance while having fast clean builds when using the build cache.
Remember, the best way to do work faster is to not do work that doesnâ€™t need doing.

Be aware that your journey is not done here.
You should invest into keeping your build well behaved and check manually or automatically that you are still making effective use of the build cache.

Our journey is also not done here. We will continue improving the build cache and give you more tools to make your builds even faster.
