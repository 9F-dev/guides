= Building Java Applications

This guide demonstrates how to use Gradle's Build Init plugin to create a new Java application that follows Gradle conventions.

== What you'll need

* About [.time-to-complete-text]#NN#
* A text editor
* A command prompt
* A https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Development Kit] (JDK), version 8 or higher
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or better

== Check the user manual

Gradle comes with a built-in plugin called the Build Init plugin. It is documented in the link:{user-manual}build_init_plugin.html[Gradle User Manual].
The plugin provides a task, called `init`, that generates the project. The plugin also uses the (also built-in) `wrapper` task to create a Gradle wrapper script, `gradlew`.

== Setup

The first step is to create a folder for the new project and change directory into it.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ mkdir demo
$ cd demo
----

== Run the init task

From inside the new project directory, run the `init` task and select `java-application` project type when prompted. For the other questions, press enter to use the default values.

[listing.terminal.sample-command,user-inputs="2|3|1|||"]
----
$ gradle init
> Task :wrapper

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 2

Select implementation language:
  1: C++
  2: Groovy
  3: Java
  4: Kotlin
  5: Swift
Enter selection (default: Java) [1..5] 3

Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1

Select test framework:
  1: JUnit 4
  2: TestNG
  3: Spock
  4: JUnit Jupiter
Enter selection (default: JUnit 4) [1..4]

Project name (default: demo):

Source package (default: demo):

If you prefer the Kotlin DSL, you can select `kotlin` for the build script DSL.

The `init` task runs the `wrapper` task first, which generates the `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` wrapper scripts. Then it creates the new project with the following structure:

        └── resources

<1> Generated folder for wrapper files
<2> Default Java source folder
<3> Default Java test folder

== Review the generated project files

The `settings.gradle` file is heavily commented, but has only one active line:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy-dsl/code", files="settings.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin-dsl/code", files="settings.gradle.kts[]"]
====

This sets the name of the root project to "demo", which overrides the default behavior of naming the project after the directory it's in.

The generated `build.gradle` file also has many comments. The active portion is reproduced here (note version numbers for the dependencies may be updated in later versions of Gradle):

====
include::sample[dir="groovy-dsl/code",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin-dsl/code",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====
<1> public Bintray Artifactory repository
<2> Google Guava library
<3> JUnit testing library
<4> Class with "main" method (used by Application plugin)

The build file adds the `java` and `application` plugins. The former support Java projects. The latter lets you designate one class as having a `main` method, which can be executed by the build from the command line. In the demo, the name of the `main` class is `App`.

The file `src/main/java/demo/App.java` is shown here:

.src/main/java/App.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}/groovy-dsl/code/src/main/java/demo/App.java[]
----
<1> Called by Application plugin "run" task

The test class, `src/test/java/demo/AppTest.java` is shown next:

.src/test/java/AppTest.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}/groovy-dsl/code/src/test/java/demo/AppTest.java[]
----

The generated test class has a single test annotated with JUnit's `@Test` annotation. The test instantiates the `App` class, invokes the `getGreeting` method, and checks that the returned value is not null.

== Execute the build

To build the project, run the `build` task. You can use the regular `gradle` command, but when a project includes a wrapper script, it is considered good form to use it instead.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew build
include::{samplesoutputdir}/build.txt[]
----

NOTE: The first time you run the wrapper script, `gradlew`, there may be a delay while that version of `gradle` is downloaded and stored locally in your `~/.gradle/wrapper/dists` folder.

The first time you run the build, Gradle will check whether or not you already have the Guava and JUnit libraries in your cache under your `~/.gradle` directory. If not, the libraries will be downloaded and stored there. The next time you run the build, the cached versions will be used. The `build` task compiles the classes, runs the tests, and generates a test report.

You can view the test report by opening the HTML output file, located at `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.

A sample report is shown here:

== Run the application

Because the Gradle build used the Application plugin, you can run the application from the command line. First, use the `tasks` task to see what task has been added by the plugin.

----
$ ./gradlew tasks
:tasks

------------------------------------------------------------
All tasks runnable from root project
------------------------------------------------------------

Application tasks
-----------------
run - Runs this project as a JVM application

// ... many other tasks ...
----

The `run` task tells Gradle to execute the `main` method in the class assigned to the `mainClassName` property.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew run
include::{samplesoutputdir}/run.txt[]
----


== Summary
