= Building and Testing Swift Libraries

This guide demonstrates how to use Gradle's Build Init plugin to produce a Swift library that follows Gradle conventions.

== What you'll need

* About [.time-to-complete-text]#NN#
* A text editor
* A command prompt
* The https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Development Kit] (JDK), version 8 or higher
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or better
* An installed Swift compiler. See which link:{user-manual}building_swift_projects.html#sec:swift_supported_tool_chain[Swift tool chains] are supported by Gradle.

== Check the user manual

Gradle ships with the link:{user-manual}build_init_plugin.html[Build Init plugin], which provides an easy way to generate projects of various types using the `init` task.  This task will also execute the link:{language-reference}org.gradle.api.tasks.wrapper.Wrapper.html[`wrapper` task] to create a link:{user-manual}gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle wrapper script], `gradlew`.

== Setup

The first step is to create a folder for the new project and change directory into it.

[listing.terminal]
----
$ mkdir building-swift-libraries
$ cd building-swift-libraries
----

== Run the init task

From inside the new project directory, run the `init` task and select the `library` project type and the `Swift` language when prompted. For the other questions, press enter to use the default values.

[listing.terminal,user-inputs="3|6|1|"]
----
$ gradle init

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 3

Select implementation language:
  1: C++
  2: Groovy
  3: Java
  4: Kotlin
  5: Scala
  6: Swift
Enter selection (default: Java) [1..6] 6

Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1

Project name (default: building-swift-libraries):

> Task :init

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed

If you prefer the Kotlin DSL, you can select `kotlin` for the build script DSL.

The `init` task runs the `wrapper` task first, which generates the `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` wrapper scripts. Then it creates the new project with the following structure:

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]

├── build.gradle
├── gradle          // <1>
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar

            ├── HelloTests.swift
            └── LinuxMain.swift

        └── swift   // <3>
            ├── HelloTests.swift
            └── LinuxMain.swift
----
<1> Generated folder for wrapper files
<2> Default Swift source folder
<3> Default Swift test folder

NOTE: The Gradle source layout convention can be customized to fit any source layout.
See the link:{user-manual}building_swift_projects.html#sec:custom_swift_source_set_paths[customizing Swift source] section of the {user-manual-name} as well as the https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/swift/swift-package-manager[custom source layout sample] for a demonstration.

== Review the generated project files

The `settings.gradle` file is heavily commented, but has only one active line:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy-dsl/code", files="settings.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin-dsl/code", files="settings.gradle.kts[]"]
====

This sets the name of the root project to "building-swift-libraries", which overrides the default behavior of naming the project after the directory it's in.

The generated `build.gradle` file also has many comments. The active portion is reproduced here:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy-dsl/code",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin-dsl/code",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

The build file adds the `swift-library` and `xctest` plugins:

* The `swift-library` plugin automatically generates a library component configurable via the link:{language-reference}org.gradle.language.swift.SwiftLibrary.html[library] extension DSL.
* The `xctest` plugin automatically generates a bundle (on macOS) or an executable (on Linux) component that depends on the library.
It also adds a new  _verification task_ that assembles and tests the binary.
The XCTest component is configurable via the link:{language-reference}org.gradle.nativeplatform.test.xctest.SwiftXCTestSuite.html[xctest] extension DSL.

NOTE: The `xctest` requires an executable entry point only on Linux. Gradle supports the `LinuxMain.swift` pattern out-of-the-box.

== Execute the build

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew build
include::{samplesoutputdir}/build.txt[]
----

NOTE: The first time you run link:{user-manual}gradle_wrapper.html[the wrapper script], `gradlew`, there may be a delay while that version of `gradle` is downloaded and stored locally in your `~/.gradle/wrapper/dists` folder.

The `build` task compiles the Swift sources, links the object files into a shared library, and runs the tests.
To build a static library, please refer to the https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/swift/static-library[static library sample].

NOTE: Dependencies on other projects isn't covered in this guide.
To learn more about this subject, have a look at the https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/swift/transitive-dependencies[transitive dependency sample] for a demonstration.

NOTE: Publishing libraries to Maven repositories is outside the scope of this guide.
To learn more about this subject, have a look at the https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/swift/simple-library[simple library sample] for a demonstration.

NOTE: To learn more about Gradle's Xcode integration and how to configure it, see the Gradle link:{user-manual}xcode_plugin.html[user guide].

== Summary

You have created a Swift library with XCTest. In doing so, you saw:

* How to generate a Swift libraries
* How the generate build file and sample Swift files are structured
* How to run the build with it's tests

== Next Steps

* Make your way to the https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/[native samples repository] to see the Swift plugins in action for common scenarios such as https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/swift/transitive-dependencies[transitive dependencies], https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/swift/swift-package-manager[custom source layout], and https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/swift/static-library[static library].
