= Creating Build Scans

A build scan is a shareable and centralized record of a build that provides insights into what happened and why. By applying the build scan plugin to your project, you can publish build scans to https://scans.gradle.com for free.

== What you'll create

This guide shows you how to publish build scans ad-hoc without any build script modifications. You will also learn how to modify a build script to enable build scans for all builds of a given project. Optionally, you will also modify an init script to enable build scans for all of your projects.

== What you'll need

* Either your own sample project, or you can use the sample project available from Gradle
* Access to the Internet
* Access to your email
* About +++<span class="time-to-complete-text"></span>+++

== Select a sample project

Gradle makes available a simple Java project that you can use to demonstrate build scan capabilities. If you wish to use it, https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-scan-quickstart[clone or download the repository].

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-scan-quickstart
Cloning into 'gradle-build-scan-quickstart'...
$ cd gradle-build-scan-quickstart
----

If you prefer to use your own project, you can skip this step.

== Auto-apply the build scan plugin

Starting with Gradle 4.3, you can enable build scans without any additional configuration in your build script. When using the command line option `--scan` to publish a build scan, the required build scan plugin is applied automatically. Before the end of the build, you are asked to accept the license agreement on the command line. The following console output demonstrates the behavior.

[listing.terminal.sample-command,user-inputs="yes"]
----
$ ./gradlew build --scan
> Task :compileJava
> Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :classes
> Task :jar
> Task :assemble
> Task :compileTestJava
> Task :processTestResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :testClasses
> Task :test
> Task :check
> Task :build

Publishing a build scan to scans.gradle.com requires accepting the Gradle Terms of Service defined at https://gradle.com/terms-of-service. Do you accept these terms? [yes, no] yes

This mechanism makes it very easy to generate ad-hoc, one-off build scans without having to configure the build scan plugin in your build. If you need finer grained configuration, you can configure the build scan plugin in a build or init script as described in the following sections.

== Enable build scans on all builds of your project

For Gradle 2.x-5.x, you need to apply the `com.gradle.build-scan` plugin to your root build script.
For Gradle 6.0, you need to apply the `com.gradle.enterprise` plugin to your `settings` script.

Follow the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#applying_the_plugin[Gradle Build Scan plugin docs] to apply the build scan plugin to your project.

== Accept the license agreement

In order to publish build scans to https://scans.gradle.com, you need to accept the license agreement.
This can be done ad-hoc via the command line when publishing, but can also be specified in your Gradle build file, by adding the following section:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy-dsl/build-scan-from-build-script",files="settings.gradle[tags=build-scan-dsl]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin-dsl/build-scan-from-build-script",files="settings.gradle.kts[tags=build-scan-dsl]"]
====

The `buildScan` block allows you to configure the plugin. Here you are setting two properties necessary to accept the license agreement.
Other properties are available. See the https://docs.gradle.com/build-scan-plugin/[Build Scans User Manual] for details.

== Publish a build scan

A build scan is published using a command-line flag called `--scan`.

Run a `build` task with the `--scan` option. When the build is completed, after uploading the build data to scans.gradle.com, you will be presented with a link to see your build scan.

----
$ ./gradlew build --scan

include::{samples-dir}/build-scan-from-build-script.sample.out[]
----

== Access the build scan online

The first time you follow the link, you will be asked to activate the created build scan.

The email you receive to activate your build scan will look similar to:

image::build_scan_email.png[width=600]

Follow the link provided in the email, and you will see the created build scan.

image::build_scan_page.png[]

You can now explore all the information contained in the build scan, including the time taken for tasks to execute, the time required during each stage of the build, the results of any tests, plugins used and other dependencies, any command-line switches used, and more.

== Enable build scans for all builds (optional)

You can avoid having to add the plugin and license agreement to every build by https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#many-projects[using a Gradle init script]. 

There are additional capabilities you can add to the script, such as under what conditions to publish the scan information. For details, see the https://docs.gradle.com/build-scan-plugin/[Build Scans User Manual].

== Summary

In this guide, you learned how to:

* Generate a build scan
* View the build scan information online
* Create an init script to enable build scans for all builds
