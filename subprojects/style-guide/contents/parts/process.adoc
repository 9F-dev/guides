== Process

These guidelines are related to the processes around writing and publishing the guides.

=== Include GitHub issue references into commit messages

This ties the commit to a particular issue within the GitHub UI, making it easy to navigate between the two. Every commit should reference at least the issue covering the guide that you're working on.

Use the text `Issue: <org>/<repo>#<issueNumber>` within the commit message, for example "Issue: gradle-guides/gradle-guides.github.io#12".

=== Use proper git author metadata

Make sure that git's `user.name` property is your full, real name. The `user.email` property should be a valid email address for you.

For those with `gradle.com` addresses, make sure that `user.email` references that email address.
