== Topical guides

A topical guide has very few special requirements, which we cover here.

=== Use a title with a readable form of "On <topic>"

For example, "_On_ Performance" or "_On_ Migrating from Maven to Gradle".

Don't use the _On_ when creating the repository, just allow for the title to be readable in that way.
